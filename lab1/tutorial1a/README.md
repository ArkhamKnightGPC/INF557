# Tutorial 1a

To compile the programs you can use the individual Makefile directives

- **make hello-world**
- **make international-hello-world**
- **make fancy-hello-world**

Or use the **all** directive by running

- **make**

The **fancy-hello-world** program will require inputing the name via **stdin**(keyboard). The function **hello_string** is then called and prints the desired message.
