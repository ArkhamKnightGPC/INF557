Assignments from the course Fundamentals of Modern Computer Networking at Ecole polytechnique.

- **Lab1**: Network Application Programming

The goal of this lab is to work through the basics of network programming in C by building a "web client": an application that can connect to a website, download a webpage, and save it to a file on our local computer.  This lab shows how to write networked programs using the transport protocols TCP and UDP.
